Rope climbing robot senior undergrad Project


As a senior in the Engineering and Computer Science program at Oakland University we were required to complete a group project in a semester long class.  This group project consisted of six members all from various engineering majors. Electrical, Mechanical, Systems, Computer Engineering and Computer Science. 

Each group was tasked with building an autonomous robot to climb and descent a rope hung from the engineering building tower. Additional criteria involved the ringing of a bell at the top of the building at a known distance from the rope.    We were also required to have the robot calculate the distance traveled and audibly broadcast how far it has climbed.  We were not allowed to have any wires connected to the robot from the ground.  

Grading criteria was based on the final presentation and performance.  Performance was judged on the accuracy of the distance measurements,  speed of the robot and completion of criteria.

Even thought we worked together on the project, each of us focused on specific areas based on our academic program.  Since i was a Computer Science major i focused on aspects of the project requiring sensors and logic,

It was decided that the motion mechanical movement of the robot would be controlled via mechanical switches and that the distance measuring and reporting would be controlled via micro-controller logic. 


My first task was to decide on a method of measuring the distance traveled.   The document below describes the method we decided on.
